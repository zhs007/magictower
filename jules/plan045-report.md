# Report for TOS Image Upload in gen_doubao_image Service (plan045)

## 1. Task Summary

The task was to implement a feature in the `gen_doubao_image` gRPC service to handle reference image uploads to Volcengine TOS. The service receives images as byte arrays, needed to upload them to TOS, generate pre-signed URLs, and then use these URLs when calling the Doubao image generation API.

## 2. Execution Process

The implementation followed the plan laid out in `jules/plan045.md`.

1.  **Dependency Management:** I started by adding the `github.com/volcengine/ve-tos-golang-sdk/v2` dependency to the `go.mod` file using the `go get` command. This was a straightforward step and completed without issues.

2.  **Core Logic Implementation:** I modified the `GenerateImage` function in `services/gen_doubao_image/main.go`.
    - **Configuration:** I added logic to read TOS credentials and configuration (`TOS_ACCESS_KEY`, `TOS_SECRET_KEY`, `TOS_ENDPOINT`, `TOS_REGION`, `TOS_BUCKET_NAME`) from environment variables. I also added a check to ensure all required variables are set.
    - **TOS Client:** I implemented the initialization of the TOS client.
    - **Upload and URL Generation:** I created a loop to process the incoming images. For each image, the code now:
        - Calculates a SHA256 hash of the image data.
        - Creates a unique object key using the format `imgs/[hash].png`.
        - Uploads the image bytes to the configured TOS bucket.
        - Generates a pre-signed GET URL for the uploaded object.
    - **API Integration:** The generated pre-signed URLs are collected into a slice and assigned to the `Image` field of the `GenerateImagesRequest` struct, which is then sent to the Doubao API.

3.  **Testing and Verification:** As I did not have access to real TOS credentials, I could not perform an end-to-end test. However, I carefully reviewed the implemented code against the official `ve-tos-golang-sdk` examples and documentation. I also added extensive logging to trace the key steps of the process: object key generation, upload attempts, and URL generation. This will be crucial for debugging in a live environment.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was the inability to perform live testing. I mitigated this by:
-   **Relying on Documentation:** Closely following the provided code examples for the TOS SDK.
-   **Defensive Programming:** Adding checks for environment variables to ensure the service fails fast with a clear error message if not configured properly.
-   **Logging:** Implementing detailed logging that will provide visibility into the process when the service is deployed.

The implementation itself was smooth, as the requirements were clear and the SDK documentation was sufficient.

## 4. Final Outcome

The `gen_doubao_image` service is now capable of handling image uploads to TOS as part of the image generation flow. The implementation is complete and matches the requirements of the task. The next step is to deploy the service with the correct environment variables in a staging or production environment to verify the functionality with live credentials.
