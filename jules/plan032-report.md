# Task Report for Plan 032: rmbg 2.0 gRPC Service

## 1. Task Summary

The goal of this task was to create a gRPC service for "rmbg 2.0" (remove background). The service was implemented in Python 3.12, containerized using Docker, and integrated into the existing monorepo structure.

## 2. Execution Summary

The task was executed according to the plan, with some debugging and iteration required during the verification phase.

### 2.1. Directory and Protocol Setup
- Created the `protos/` directory for protocol definitions.
- Created the `services/rmbg/` directory for the service implementation.
- Defined the `RmbgService` in `protos/rmbg.proto` with a `RemoveBackground` RPC method that accepts and returns image data as bytes.

### 2.2. Python Service Implementation
- Set up the Python project structure under `services/rmbg/src/`.
- Created `requirements.txt` with the necessary dependencies: `grpcio`, `grpcio-tools`, `Pillow`, `rembg`, and `onnxruntime`.
- Generated the Python gRPC stubs from the proto file.
- Implemented the gRPC server logic in `services/rmbg/src/main.py`.

### 2.3. Containerization
- Created a `Dockerfile` in `services/rmbg/` to containerize the service.
- The Dockerfile uses a Python 3.12 base image, installs dependencies, and runs the server.

### 2.4. Verification
- Built the Docker image and ran the container.
- Created a test client (`services/rmbg/src/client.py`) to perform an end-to-end test.
- Successfully sent an image to the service, had its background removed, and saved the result.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

Several issues were encountered during the verification phase:

1.  **`rembg` Version Incompatibility**: The initial choice of `rembg==2.0.50` was incompatible with the Python 3.12 environment.
    -   **Solution**: Updated `requirements.txt` to use `rembg==2.0.67`, a version compatible with Python 3.12.

2.  **Missing `onnxruntime` Dependency**: The server crashed on startup due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `onnxruntime`. This is a hidden dependency of `rembg`.
    -   **Solution**: Added `onnxruntime` to `requirements.txt` and rebuilt the Docker image.

3.  **Client `FileNotFoundError`**: The test client initially failed because the path to the test image was incorrect for the execution context.
    -   **Solution**: Modified the client script to use paths relative to the project root, making it runnable from a consistent location.

4.  **Server `TypeError`**: The server returned an error `expected bytes, Image found`. This was due to a misunderstanding of the `rembg` library's return types.
    -   **Solution**: Corrected the server logic to pass the raw image bytes directly to `rembg.remove()`, which simplifies the code and ensures the correct data types are used.

5.  **Client `UNAVAILABLE` RPC Error**: The client failed to connect to the server. This was likely because the server was taking a long time to initialize (downloading ML models on its first run), causing the client to time out.
    -   **Solution**: Increased the RPC timeout in the client from 30 seconds to 120 seconds. This gave the server enough time to become ready and successfully process the request.

## 4. Final Outcome

The `rmbg` gRPC service has been successfully implemented, containerized, and verified. It is ready for use. The final code includes the service implementation, Dockerfile, and a test client. The project structure has been updated to include the new `protos` and `services` directories.
