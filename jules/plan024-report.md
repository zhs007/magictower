# Report for Plan 024: Final Game Balance Implementation

## 1. Summary of Work

This plan involved a second, complete redesign of the initial game balance based on extensive user feedback. The primary goal was to create a more challenging and engaging initial set of battles for the player.

The work performed includes:
-   **Complete Stat Re-balancing:** All monster and player progression stats were recalculated from the ground up to meet a new, high-threat target. The new design ensures the first 7 monsters deal approximately 82% of the player's starting HP, creating a much more engaging and challenging experience.
-   **Enhanced Level-Up:** The player's stat gains at Level 2 were made more substantial to provide a better sense of progression.
-   **Data Consistency:** All data files were updated to be consistent with the game's logic, including enforcing minimum stat values and aligning Level 1 data across all files.
-   **Comprehensive Validation:** The validation test suite (`src/core/tests/balance.test.ts`) was significantly updated to assert all the new values and rules of the redesigned system.

## 2. Final Outcome

After a thorough redesign and implementation process, the new game balance is now in place. All data files (`leveldata.json`, and the three `level1_` monster files) have been updated with their final, verified values.

The entire project test suite, including the heavily modified balance checker, passes completely (114 out of 114 tests passed). The final design successfully meets all of the user's latest, more challenging requirements. The initial game experience should now be much closer to the user's desired vision.
