# Plan for Refactoring import.meta.glob

## Original Request

The user wants to refactor the codebase to decouple the `dataManager` from Vite's `import.meta.glob` feature. This will allow the `dataManager` to be used in a non-Vite environment, such as a script running in Node.js.

The key requirements are:

1.  Create a `importMetaGlob` function to replace all usages of `import.meta.glob`.
2.  The default implementation of `importMetaGlob` should just call `import.meta.glob`.
3.  Add a `setImportMetaGlob` function to allow overriding the default implementation.
4.  Create a Node.js-based implementation of `importMetaGlob` in a script under the `scripts` directory.
5.  Use `setImportMetaGlob` in the script to set the new implementation.
6.  Write tests to ensure everything works correctly.
7.  Document the changes in `jules.md` and create a report in `jules/plan1-report.md`.
8.  Ensure GitHub Actions pass.
9.  Update `agents.md` if necessary.

## My Understanding

This is a refactoring task to introduce an abstraction layer over `import.meta.glob`. This will make the code more modular and allow parts of it (like the data and asset loading) to be used in different environments.

The main files to change are:
- `src/data/data-manager.ts`
- `src/renderer/renderer.ts`

A new module will be created to house the `importMetaGlob` and `setImportMetaGlob` functions. A new script will be created to demonstrate the usage in a Node.js environment. Comprehensive testing is crucial.
