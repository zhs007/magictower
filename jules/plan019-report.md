# Plan 019 Execution Report: Floating Text Manager

## 1. Summary of Work

This report details the successful execution of `plan019`. The primary goal was to create a centralized, generic `FloatingTextManager` to handle all floating text animations within the game, such as damage numbers and item pickup notifications. This refactoring improves code quality, maintainability, and provides a better user experience by preventing overlapping text.

## 2. Changes Implemented

-   **`src/renderer/ui/floating-text-manager.ts`**: Created the new `FloatingTextManager` class. This class manages a queue of animation requests and processes them sequentially to avoid visual clutter. It uses a type-based system to apply different styles (color, font size) for various events (damage, item gain, etc.).
-   **`src/renderer/renderer.ts`**:
    -   Instantiated the `FloatingTextManager` and made it accessible.
    -   Refactored the `animateAttack` function to delegate the creation of damage text to the new manager.
    -   Added a new public method, `showPlayerFloatingText`, to easily trigger floating text above the player.
-   **`src/scenes/game-scene.ts`**: Updated the `handleItemPickup` logic to call `renderer.showPlayerFloatingText` after an item is successfully picked up, providing immediate visual feedback to the player.
-   **`jules.md`**: Added a new section documenting the `FloatingTextManager`, explaining its purpose, how to use it, and the available text types.

## 3. Testing and Verification

-   **New Tests**: Created a new test file, `src/renderer/ui/floating-text-manager.test.ts`, with a comprehensive suite of unit tests. These tests verify the manager's queuing mechanism, sequential processing, and correct handling of different request types.
-   **Regression Testing**: After implementing all changes, the full test suite (`npm test`) was run to ensure that the new feature did not introduce any regressions. All tests passed.

## 4. Conclusion

The implementation of `plan019` is complete and meets all acceptance criteria. The new `FloatingTextManager` provides a robust and extensible system for handling all floating text in the game, improving both the developer experience and the end-user's visual clarity. The code is tested and documented.
