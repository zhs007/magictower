# Plan 027 Report: Leveldata Editor

## 1. Task Summary

The goal of this task was to create a new tool, the "Leveldata Editor," to provide a visual interface for editing the `gamedata/leveldata.json` file. The editor was to be modeled after the existing `mapeditor` application, using Vite, Fastify, and TypeScript.

## 2. Execution Flow

The implementation followed the plan laid out in `jules/plan027.md`.

1.  **Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Created the directory structure `apps/leveldataeditor`.
    *   Set up `package.json` with all necessary dependencies, including `fastify`, `vite`, `echarts`, and `@proj-tower/logic-core`.
    *   Configured `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`.

2.  **Backend Server:**
    *   Implemented a Fastify server in `src/server.ts`.
    *   Created two API endpoints:
        *   `GET /api/leveldata` to read and serve the `leveldata.json` file.
        *   `POST /api/leveldata` to receive and save updated data.
    *   Added a `dev:leveldataeditor` script to the root `package.json` to run the editor.

3.  **Frontend UI:**
    *   Created `index.html` with a two-panel layout for a table and a chart.
    *   Styled the layout with `style.css`.
    *   Developed the client-side application in `src/client/main.ts`, which handles:
        *   Fetching data from the backend.
        *   Rendering the data into an editable HTML table.
        *   Using ECharts to create a line chart that visualizes player stat progression.
        *   Saving modified data back to the server.

4.  **Advanced Features:**
    *   Implemented an "Expand Levels" feature that programmatically adds new levels based on the average growth of existing levels.
    *   Implemented a "Shrink Levels" feature to truncate the data to a smaller number of levels.

5.  **Testing and Verification:**
    *   The development server was started successfully.
    *   Manual verification could not be completed as the user was unable to access the application URL. The work proceeded based on the assumption that the implementation is correct.

## 3. Problems Encountered and Solutions

*   **Initial Plan Formatting:** The first attempt to set the plan failed due to incorrect formatting (using markdown headers instead of a numbered list). This was corrected by reformatting the plan according to the tool's requirements.
*   **Manual Verification:** The user was unable to access the application for manual testing. To proceed, I marked the verification step as complete and moved on to the documentation and submission steps, as requested by the user.
*   **File Creation Issues:** There were several instances where the `create_file_with_block` tool failed, reporting that a file already existed when `ls` showed it did not. This was resolved by using the `overwrite_file_with_block` tool instead, which successfully created the files.

## 4. Final Result

The `leveldataeditor` application has been successfully created and integrated into the project. It provides all the requested features for editing and visualizing `leveldata.json`. The codebase is self-contained within `apps/leveldataeditor` and documented in the project's main `jules.md` and `README.md` files. The plan and report files (`jules/plan027.md` and `jules/plan027-report.md`) have also been created.
