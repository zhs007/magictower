# Report for Plan 027: Implement Equipment and Item Entities on Maps

## 1. Summary of Work

This report details the work done to address an issue where equipment and item entities defined in the map data were not being correctly loaded into the game world. The primary goal was to ensure that items like the sword and potion on `floor_02.json` appear as interactive entities that the player can pick up.

The work involved modifying the game's state initialization logic, adding a new test case to verify the fix, and ensuring that all existing functionality remained intact.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1. Problem Analysis

My initial investigation confirmed that `mapdata/floor_02.json` correctly defined a sword with `type: "equipment"` and a potion with `type: "item"`. However, the game was not displaying them.

By tracing the data loading process, I pinpointed the issue in the `createInitialState` function within `src/core/state.ts`. The function had logic to handle entities of type `monster` and `item`, but it was missing a case for `equipment`. This meant that any entity with `type: "equipment"` was being ignored by the game logic, even though it was being added to the generic `entities` list.

### 2.2. Code Changes

To resolve this, I made the following changes to `src/core/state.ts`:

1.  **Imported `IEquipment`**: I added `IEquipment` to the import list from `./types` to make the type available in the file.
2.  **Initialized `equipments` Collection**: In `createInitialState`, I added a new `equipments` object of type `Record<string, IEquipment>` to hold the equipment data for the current floor.
3.  **Added Logic for `equipment` Type**: I added a new `else if (entityInfo.type === 'equipment')` block. This block:
    -   Fetches the corresponding equipment data from the `dataManager`.
    -   Creates a new equipment object, combining the base data with the `x` and `y` coordinates from the map's entity definition.
    -   Adds the new equipment object to both the `entities` collection (for rendering) and the new `equipments` collection (for game logic).
4.  **Updated Return Value**: I modified the `return` statement of `createInitialState` to include the newly populated `equipments` collection in the `GameState` object.

### 2.3. Testing

To ensure the correctness of the fix and prevent future regressions, I performed the following testing activities:

1.  **New Unit Test**: I added a new test case to `src/core/tests/state.test.ts`. This test:
    -   Mocks a `MapLayout` object containing an `equipment` entity.
    -   Mocks the `dataManager` to return predefined equipment data.
    -   Calls `GameStateManager.createInitialState` with the mock data.
    -   Asserts that the resulting `GameState` contains the equipment in its `equipments` collection with the correct properties.
2.  **Full Test Suite**: After implementing the changes and adding the new test, I ran the entire test suite using `npm test`. All 116 tests passed, confirming that the new code works as expected and did not introduce any regressions. The test run initially failed due to missing dependencies, which I resolved by running `npm install`.

## 3. Conclusion

The changes have been successfully implemented and verified. The game now correctly loads equipment from the map data, making them available to the player. The addition of a dedicated unit test will help ensure this functionality remains stable in the future.
