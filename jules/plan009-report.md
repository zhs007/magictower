# Plan 009 Report: Special Items, Doors, and Polish

## Summary

This report details the work completed for plan 009, which focused on implementing special game features, adding polish, and conducting thorough testing. All major tasks outlined in the plan have been successfully completed.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Special Items

The following special items have been added to the game:

-   **Magic Bomb**: A consumable item that destroys all monsters of a specific type on the current floor.
-   **Monster Manual**: A permanent unlock that will allow the player to view monster stats.
-   **Snowflake**: Grants the player two first strikes in combat.
-   **Cross**: Provides a one-time, permanent boost to the player's attack and defense.

The logic for picking up these items is handled in `src/core/logic.ts`, and a new `handleUseBomb` function was added. The `IPlayer` and `IItem` types in `src/core/types.ts` were updated to support these new items.

### 2. Special Doors

Event-triggered doors have been implemented. These doors open automatically when a specific condition is met, such as defeating a particular monster. The logic for this is handled in `handleEndBattle` in `src/core/logic.ts`.

### 3. Visual and Audio Effects

-   **Audio**: The `howler.js` library has been integrated to provide sound effects. An `AudioManager` class was created to manage audio playback. Sounds have been added for attacking, picking up items, and opening doors.
-   **Visuals**: A simple visual effect has been added to combat. When a character is attacked, they will flash red to indicate damage.

## Testing

-   **Unit Tests**: A new test file, `src/core/tests/plan009.test.ts`, was created to provide comprehensive unit tests for all new gameplay logic. This includes tests for each special item and the event-triggered door. All tests are passing.
-   **Manual Review**: A manual code review was conducted to ensure all changes are consistent with the project's architecture and coding standards.

## Conclusion

Plan 009 has been successfully executed, adding significant new features and polish to the game. The codebase has been extended in a modular and testable way, and the game is now closer to a feature-complete state.
