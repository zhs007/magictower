# Report for Plan 041: Create Monster Editor

## 1. Task Summary

The goal of this plan was to create a new tool, `monstereditor`, as part of the Project Tower monorepo. This editor is a web application designed for viewing monster data and simulating battles. It was built using Vite for the frontend, Fastify for the backend, and TypeScript.

The main features included:
- A dual-panel UI: a chat panel on the left and an editor panel on the right.
- The editor panel contains a configuration area for selecting a player and a monster, and a rendering area for visualizing a battle simulation.
- The backend serves monster and level data from the `gamedata` directory.
- The frontend uses `@proj-tower/maprender` to display characters on a map and simulates combat on click.

## 2. Execution Summary

The project was executed following the 8 steps outlined in the plan.

1.  **Project Scaffolding**: Created the directory structure and all necessary configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.) for the new `monstereditor` app, modeling it after the existing `mapeditor` app.
2.  **Backend Server (Fastify)**: Implemented a Fastify server with API endpoints to read monster and level data from the file system. A `run-server.ts` script was created to launch the server with Vite middleware.
3.  **Root Configuration**: Added a `dev:monstereditor` script to the root `package.json` to allow for easy startup of the new application.
4.  **Frontend Layout**: Created the initial HTML structure and CSS for the two-column layout, including placeholders for the different UI sections.
5.  **Frontend Selection Area**: Implemented the interactive UI for selecting player and monster stats. This included creating a modal for player configuration and fetching data from the backend to populate dropdowns dynamically.
6.  **Frontend Battle Simulation Rendering**: Integrated the `@proj-tower/maprender` package to render a 16x16 map. `CharacterEntity` instances for the player and monster were created and displayed. Zoom controls and stat overlays were also implemented.
7.  **Battle Simulation Logic**: Added a `simulateBattle` function to the frontend to calculate the outcome of a fight. A click event on the rendering area triggers the simulation, with the results displayed in a popup.
8.  **Final Documentation**: Created this report and updated the project's main documentation files.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Verifying Directory Creation

During the scaffolding phase, I encountered an issue where the `ls` tool would not display the empty directories I had created with `mkdir -p`. This led to some initial confusion and incorrect file placement.

-   **Initial Incorrect Assumption**: I assumed the `mkdir` command had failed and re-ran it. I then created server files in the wrong location because I believed the `src` directory didn't exist.
-   **Diagnosis**: After creating files, a subsequent `ls` call revealed the directory structure, showing that the initial `mkdir` had worked but `ls` simply doesn't list empty directories in its default output.
-   **Solution**: I used `rename_file` to move the misplaced files into their correct locations (`apps/monstereditor/src/`). This corrected the project structure and allowed the subsequent steps to proceed correctly.

### Challenge 2: Replicating Battle Logic

The core battle logic in `packages/logic-core` is designed for a turn-by-turn state machine, which was not suitable for the instant simulation required by the editor.

-   **Problem**: There was no single function in `logic-core` to "run a full battle".
-   **Solution**: I created a new helper function, `simulateBattle`, directly within the editor's client-side code (`app.ts`). This function encapsulates the turn-based combat loop (checking for a winner, calculating damage, switching turns) and immediately returns the final result. This provided the required functionality without needing to modify the shared `logic-core` package.

## 4. Final Outcome

The `monstereditor` application was successfully created and meets all the requirements of the initial request. The frontend is interactive, the backend serves the necessary data, and the battle simulation is functional. The project structure is consistent with the rest of the monorepo.
