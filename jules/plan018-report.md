# Plan 018 Execution Report

## 1. Summary of Work

This report details the execution of `plan018`, which involved introducing a `tileAssets` mapping to the map data files to create a stable link between map layout values and texture assets. This change makes the rendering system more robust and less reliant on hardcoded fallback logic.

## 2. Changes Implemented

-   **`mapdata/floor_01.json`**: Added the `tileAssets` property to the map file, mapping `0` to `map_floor` and `1` to `map_wall`.
-   **`src/data/types.ts`**: Updated the `MapLayout` interface to include the optional `tileAssets` property.
-   **`src/core/types.ts`**: Updated the `GameState` interface to include the optional `tileAssets` property.
-   **`src/core/state.ts`**: Modified the `createInitialState` function to copy `tileAssets` from the `MapLayout` to the `GameState`.
-   **`src/renderer/renderer.ts`**: Updated the `drawMap` function to use the `tileAssets` mapping for rendering tiles. The implementation includes a fallback to the old rendering logic for backward compatibility with maps that do not have `tileAssets`.
-   **`scripts/check-assets.js`**: Updated the asset checking script to scan the `mapdata` directory and validate the asset IDs in the `tileAssets` mappings.

## 3. Testing and Verification

-   **New Tests**: Created a new test file `src/renderer/tests/plan018.test.ts` with three test cases to verify the new `drawMap` logic, including the `tileAssets` implementation, the fallback mechanism, and the handling of unknown tile values.
-   **Regression Testing**: Ran the full test suite (`npm test`) and fixed three failing tests that were caused by the changes. The regressions were in `src/data/tests/data-manager.test.ts` and `src/renderer/tests/renderer.test.ts`. All tests now pass.
-   **Asset Check**: Ran `npm run check-assets` to ensure all asset references are valid. The script passed successfully.

## 4. Conclusion

The implementation of `plan018` is complete and verified. The new `tileAssets` system provides a more maintainable way to handle map textures. All code changes are tested, and no regressions were introduced.
