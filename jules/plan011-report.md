# Report for Plan 011: UI Layout and Resolution Scaling

## 1. Summary of Work Completed

This plan has been successfully executed. The primary objective was to implement a new UI layout with resolution scaling, and this has been achieved. The implementation involved significant refactoring of the rendering engine and game state management to align with the new design specifications.

## 2. Key Changes and Implementations

- **UI and Resolution Scaling**:
    - A new CSS file (`src/style.css`) was created to handle responsive scaling, centering the canvas, and applying a blurred background.
    - The `index.html` was updated to use the new stylesheet and a root `<div id="app">` for the Pixi.js application.
    - `src/main.ts` was modified to initialize the Pixi application with a fixed design resolution of 1080x1920.

- **Renderer Refactoring**:
    - The `Renderer` class in `src/renderer/renderer.ts` was refactored to use `mapContainer` and `hudContainer` for better layout management.
    - The tile size was updated to 65x65 as specified.
    - A basic HUD was added to display player HP.

- **Game State Refactoring**:
    - The `GameState` structure was significantly changed. The old `Tile[][]` map with an `entityLayer` was replaced with a `number[][]` map for the layout and a separate `entities` dictionary.
    - `GameStateManager.createInitialState` was updated to generate the new state structure.
    - Core logic functions like `handleMove` were updated to work with the new state.

- **Map Update**:
    - The map data in `mapdata/floor_01.json` was expanded to a 16x16 grid.

- **Asset Creation**:
    - Placeholder PNG images were generated for the player, walls, floor, a monster, an item, and a background. This makes the game visually runnable for testing.

- **Testing**:
    - New tests were written for the `GameStateManager` and `handleMove` function.
    - The entire existing test suite was updated and fixed to be compatible with the new game state structure and other changes.
    - All 37 tests are now passing.

## 3. Outcome

The application is now in a state where the core UI framework is in place. The game is visually runnable, and the underlying logic is sound and well-tested. This provides a solid foundation for the next steps, which involve building out the HUD and other UI components.
