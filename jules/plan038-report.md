# Plan 038 Report: Entity Class and MapRender Update

## 1. Summary of Work

This task focused on introducing a new `Entity` class and updating the `MapRender` component to support a per-frame update loop for dynamic objects. This is a foundational change that will enable more complex animations and behaviors in the game.

The following tasks were completed:

-   **`Entity` Class**: A new `Entity` class was created in `packages/maprender/src/entity.ts`. It inherits from `PIXI.Container` and provides a simple action system with `setAction` and `update` methods.
-   **`MapRender` Update**: The `MapRender` class was updated to manage a set of `Entity` objects. It now has `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, and `update` methods. The `update` method iterates through all registered entities and calls their respective `update` methods, driven by the game's main ticker.
-   **TypeScript Definitions**: New type definitions for `IEntity` and `ActionCallback` were created in `packages/maprender/src/types.ts` to ensure type safety.
-   **Exports**: The new `Entity` class and types were exported from the `@proj-tower/maprender` package via its `index.ts` file.
-   **Testing**: Unit tests were added for the new functionality. This involved setting up a test environment for the `maprender` package, which previously had none. Tests for both the `Entity` class and the `MapRender` update logic were written and confirmed to pass.
-   **Documentation**: The main development document, `jules.md`, was updated to include detailed information about the new `Entity` class and the changes to `MapRender`. The `agents.md` file was also updated to ensure future agents are aware of this new core component.

## 2. Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge encountered during this task was related to the testing setup.

-   **Problem**: The initial run of the test suite did not execute the newly added tests for the `maprender` package.
-   **Investigation**: I discovered that the `packages/maprender/package.json` file was missing a `test:ci` script, which is what the root `pnpm test` command uses to trigger tests in each package.
-   **Solution**: I added the `test:ci` script to the `package.json` file and also added `vitest` as a dev dependency. After reinstalling the dependencies with `pnpm install`, the tests were successfully discovered and executed, and they all passed.

## 3. Final Result

The `maprender` package now has a robust system for managing dynamic entities and their update cycles. The code is well-documented and covered by unit tests. This change lays the groundwork for implementing more complex character animations, particle effects, and other dynamic visual elements in the game.
