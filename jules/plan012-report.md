# Plan 012 Report: Implemented Interactive Combat and Item Pickup

## Summary

This report details the successful implementation of interactive combat and item pickup systems, as outlined in `plan012.md`. The core objective was to move from a static, non-interactive system to a dynamic, animated one, providing players with clear visual feedback for their actions.

## Key Changes

### 1. Renderer Refactoring

- **Persistent Sprites:** The `Renderer` was significantly refactored to use persistent sprites for all game entities (player, monsters, items). Instead of recreating sprites on every frame, they are now created once and updated, which is essential for smooth animations.
- **Animation Library:** `gsap` was added to the project to handle all animations, providing powerful and flexible tweening capabilities.

### 2. Interaction State Machine

- A new `interactionState` was added to the `GameState`. This acts as a state machine to control the game's flow, with states for `'none'`, `'item_pickup'`, and `'battle'`.
- This state-driven approach allows the game to switch between free exploration and scripted animation sequences, preventing player input during animations.

### 3. Item Pickup with Animation

- When a player moves to pick up an item, the game now enters the `'item_pickup'` state.
- An animation sequence is triggered:
    - The player character "jumps" to the item's square.
    - The item animates upwards, shrinks, and fades out.
- After the animation, the item's effect is applied, and the game returns to the normal exploration state.

### 4. Turn-Based Combat with Animation

- The combat system was completely overhauled from a single-calculation function to a turn-based system.
- When a player engages a monster, the game enters the `'battle'` state.
- A turn-based loop begins, driven by a "ping-pong" between the game scene (handling animations) and the state manager (handling logic):
    - The attacker performs an attack animation (a small hop towards the defender).
    - A damage number floats up from the defender.
    - The game state is updated with the new HP values.
- This continues until one combatant's HP reaches zero, at which point the battle ends, and the defeated entity is removed.

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

- A new test suite was created in `src/core/tests/new_logic.test.ts` to cover the new interaction logic.
- Tests were written for all new game logic handlers (`handleStartBattle`, `handleAttack`, `handleEndBattle`, `handlePickupItem`).
- Existing tests were cleaned up, and the renderer tests were fixed to align with the refactored rendering engine.
- All tests are currently passing.

## Post-Implementation Bug Fixes and Refinements

Following the initial implementation, user feedback highlighted several issues and requested new features, which have now been addressed:

- **Game Freeze During Combat:** A critical bug was found where the game would become unresponsive during combat. This was traced to two issues:
    1.  An incorrect hardcoded entity key for the player was preventing the renderer from finding the player's sprite for animations.
    2.  The game logic in `handleAttack` was using the wrong ID to look up monster data, causing the turn-based loop to fail.
    - **Fix:** Both issues were resolved by correctly using dynamic entity keys and fixing the data lookup logic in `handleAttack`. The turn-based combat loop is now stable.

- **Missing Monster Attack:** The game freeze bug was also the cause of the missing monster attack turn. With the freeze resolved, monsters now correctly attack back in a turn-based manner.

- **Combat Round Limit:** A new feature was added to limit combat to a maximum of 8 rounds. If the battle is not decided by the end of the 8th round, combat ends, and the player is returned to their pre-battle state, free to move again.

- **Negative Damage Display:** The damage animation was updated to display the damage value as a negative number (e.g., "-9"), as requested.

## Conclusion

The implementation of `plan012` has successfully introduced a layer of dynamic, interactive animations to the game, significantly improving the user experience for combat and item collection. Subsequent bug fixes and refinements have made the system robust and aligned with all user requirements. The underlying systems are now more stable and extensible for future development.
