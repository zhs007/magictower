# Report for Plan 039: Refactor MapRender to Use Entities for Walls

## 1. Summary

This task focused on refactoring the `MapRender` class in the `@proj-tower/maprender` package. The primary goal was to eliminate the manual `wallSprites` array and instead use the existing `Entity` system for rendering static map elements like walls. This change makes the rendering logic more consistent, robust, and easier to maintain.

## 2. Execution Steps

1.  **Code Modification:**
    *   I modified `packages/maprender/src/map-render.ts`.
    *   The `wallSprites: Sprite[]` property was removed.
    *   A new `mapEntities: Entity[]` property was introduced to track entities created by the `drawMap` method.
    *   The logic in `drawMap` was updated to:
        *   Clean up old map entities from the previous draw call by iterating through `mapEntities` and using the `removeEntity` method.
        *   When encountering a tile with `isEntity: true`, it now constructs a proper `Entity` object, adds the tile's `Sprite` to it, and sets the necessary properties (`x`, `y`, `zIndex`) on the `Entity` itself.
        *   The new `Entity` is added to the renderer via `addEntity` and tracked in the `mapEntities` array.

2.  **Verification:**
    *   The project dependencies were installed using `pnpm install`.
    *   The development server was started with `pnpm dev`.
    *   A Playwright script was created to visually verify the changes.
    *   **Challenge:** The initial verification script failed because the main menu buttons were rendered inside a `<canvas>` element, not as standard DOM elements. Standard Playwright locators (`get_by_role`, `get_by_text`) could not find them.
    *   **Solution:** The script was modified to simulate a mouse click at the approximate coordinates of the "New Game" button on the canvas, which successfully started the game.
    *   A screenshot of the running game was captured, confirming that walls and other map elements were rendered correctly and that the Z-ordering was preserved.
    *   The temporary verification files and the background server process were cleaned up after verification was complete.

## 3. Outcome

The refactoring was successful. The `MapRender` class is now cleaner and uses a single, consistent mechanism for handling all rendered objects. The manual and error-prone management of `wallSprites` has been completely removed.
