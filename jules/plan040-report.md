# Plan 040 Report: CharacterEntity Refactoring

## 1. Summary

This report details the execution of Plan 040, which focused on refactoring the rendering logic to introduce a new `CharacterEntity` class. The goal was to encapsulate character-specific rendering and animation logic within the entity itself, removing it from the main `Renderer` class. This improves modularity and adheres to the project's design principles.

The refactoring was successful, and all associated tests have been updated and are passing.

## 2. Execution Flow

The plan was executed in the following steps:

1.  **Created `CharacterEntity` Class**: A new class, `CharacterEntity`, was created in `packages/maprender/src/character-entity.ts`. This class extends the base `Entity` and includes properties for `direction` and a `setDirection` method to control the character's sprite orientation.

2.  **Added Actions to `CharacterEntity`**:
    -   The `gsap` library was added as a dependency to the `@proj-tower/maprender` package to handle animations.
    -   The `attack` and `pickup` methods were implemented on `CharacterEntity`. The animation logic for these actions was moved from `apps/game/src/renderer/renderer.ts` into these new methods. This successfully encapsulated the animation logic within the entity.

3.  **Refactored the Main `Renderer`**:
    -   The `Renderer`'s internal tracking of sprites (`entitySprites: Map<string, Sprite>`) was changed to track entities (`entities: Map<string, Entity>`).
    -   The `syncSprites` method was rewritten as `syncEntities`. This new method now instantiates `CharacterEntity` for players and monsters, and generic `Entity` objects for other items, and adds them to the `MapRender`.
    -   The `FloatingTextManager` was also updated to work with the new `Map<string, Entity>` instead of sprites.

4.  **Updated `GameScene` to Use New Actions**:
    -   The `GameScene` (`apps/game/src/scenes/game-scene.ts`) was modified to call the new methods on the entities directly. Instead of calling `renderer.animateAttack()`, it now retrieves the entities from the renderer and calls `attackerEntity.attack(...)`.
    -   The now-redundant `animateAttack` and `animateItemPickup` methods were removed from the `Renderer`, simplifying its API.

5.  **Testing and Verification**:
    -   The initial run of the test suite revealed several failures in `renderer.test.ts`.
    -   The failures were caused by the refactoring: a renamed method (`syncSprites` -> `syncEntities`) and an incomplete mock for the `@proj-tower/maprender` package which was missing the new `CharacterEntity`.
    -   The tests were fixed by updating the method name and extending the mock to include `CharacterEntity` and `Entity`.
    -   A final failing test was due to a test case calling a method that had been removed (`animateItemPickup`). This obsolete test case was removed.
    -   After these fixes, the full test suite (`pnpm test`) passed without errors.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was the test failures after the refactoring. The solution was straightforward: carefully analyze the test output and update the test code to match the refactored implementation. This involved updating mocks, renaming function calls, and removing obsolete tests, which is a standard part of the refactoring process.

## 4. Conclusion

The `CharacterEntity` refactoring is complete and successful. The codebase is now cleaner, with better separation of concerns. The entity-specific logic is no longer in the main renderer, making both the `Renderer` and the new `CharacterEntity` easier to understand and maintain.
