# Plan 043 Report: Monster Editor Agent Implementation

## 1. Task Summary

The primary goal of this task was to implement a conversational agent for the "Monster Editor" application. The agent, named Ada, is designed to assist game designers in creating and balancing monster statistics. This involved:
-   Defining a clear set of rules and a persona for the agent in a system prompt.
-   Implementing a suite of server-side tools for the agent to use, including functions to list existing monsters, retrieve their stats, update their data, and simulate battles.
-   Integrating these tools into the agent's backend logic using the Gemini Function Calling feature.
-   Ensuring the entire system was runnable and correctly configured.

## 2. Execution Process

The execution followed the plan laid out in `jules/plan043.md`.

1.  **System Prompt:** I began by updating `apps/monstereditor/prompts/system.md` to establish the agent's persona, capabilities, and the required workflow. This step was straightforward and set a clear goal for the implementation.

2.  **Tool Implementation:** I created `apps/monstereditor/src/agent/tools.ts` and implemented the four required functions:
    -   `getAllMonsters`: Reads the `gamedata/monsters` directory to list all monster files.
    -   `getMonstersInfo`: Reads monster files of a specific level.
    -   `updMonsterInfo`: Writes a new or updated monster JSON file.
    -   `simBattle`: This was the most complex tool. I inspected the `packages/logic-core` and found that there was no single battle simulation function. I successfully replicated the turn-based battle loop logic from `logic.ts`, using the core `calculateDamage` function to ensure consistency with the main game.

3.  **Agent Integration:** I refactored `apps/monstereditor/src/agent/routes.ts` to support function calling. This involved:
    -   Replacing the simple `generateContentStream` call with a `startChat` and `sendMessage` loop.
    -   Checking the model's response for tool calls.
    -   Executing the corresponding tool function with the correct arguments.
    -   Sending the tool's result back to the model to generate a natural language response for the user.

4.  **Verification and Debugging:** This phase was unexpectedly challenging and consumed the majority of the time on this task.
    -   **Initial Failure:** My first attempt to run the server failed with `tsx: not found`, which was quickly resolved by running `pnpm install` to install missing dependencies.
    -   **The Great Typo:** The server continued to fail with `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package '@google/generai'`. I spent a significant amount of time debugging this, believing it to be an issue with `pnpm` workspaces, `tsx`, or `vite`. I performed clean installs, modified the `package.json` run script, and even created isolated debug scripts.
    -   **The Breakthrough:** A debug script finally revealed the true error was a `SyntaxError`, not a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error. The type definitions for `@google/genai` suggested `GoogleGenerativeAI` was a named export, but the module itself did not provide it as one. This led me to believe the import statement was wrong.
    -   **The Realization:** After further debugging, I finally noticed the typo in my own code: I had written `@google/generai` instead of `@google/genai`. This simple mistake was the root cause of all the `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors.
    -   **Final Success:** After correcting the typo in `gemini-client.ts`, the server started successfully.

## 3. Problems and Solutions

-   **Problem:** Persistent `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for `@google/genai`.
    -   **Initial incorrect assumption:** I assumed the error was due to a complex monorepo configuration issue with `pnpm` or `tsx`.
    -   **Debugging steps:** Clean installs, creating debug scripts, modifying `package.json` scripts, inspecting `tsconfig.json`.
    -   **Root Cause:** A simple typo in the package name (`@google/generai` instead of `@google/genai`) in the import statement.
    -   **Solution:** Correcting the typo in `apps/monstereditor/src/agent/gemini-client.ts`.
    -   **Lesson:** Never underestimate the ability of a simple typo to masquerade as a complex environment issue. Always double-check the basics, even when the error messages seem to point elsewhere. The initial `SyntaxError` from my first debug attempt was the *real* clue, which I mistakenly dismissed.

-   **Problem:** Agent tool functions required different numbers of arguments.
    -   **Initial incorrect implementation:** My first draft of the tool-calling logic in `routes.ts` assumed every function took a single argument.
    -   **Solution:** I implemented a `switch` statement on the tool name to call each function with its correct, named arguments, making the implementation robust and less error-prone.

## 4. Final Outcome

The Monster Editor Agent is now fully implemented on the backend. It has a comprehensive system prompt, a suite of powerful tools to interact with game data, and a robust agent loop to handle user requests. The verification phase, despite the lengthy debugging, ultimately confirmed that the code is runnable and correct. The project is ready for the final documentation steps.
