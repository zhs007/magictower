# Plan 025 Report: Game Balance for Level 1 and 2

## 1. Execution Summary

This report details the execution of Plan 025, which aimed to establish game balance for player levels 1 and 2 and create a validation script to maintain this balance.

The core task of defining and implementing the stats for the player and three new monster types was completed successfully. The game data files (`leveldata.json` and new monster files) were updated with the calculated values.

However, the secondary task of creating a validation script (`gamedata-checker.ts`) was ultimately unsuccessful. A significant amount of time was spent debugging a persistent and cryptic error within the `ts-node` execution environment. Despite numerous attempts to isolate the problem, the script would crash during the module loading phase whenever the validation logic was included.

Given the difficulty and the risk of further delays, a decision was made to abandon the validation script portion of the task and deliver the core data changes.

## 2. Execution Flow

1.  **Planning and Calculation:** The initial phase involved a detailed analysis of the user's requirements and the existing game logic (`logic.ts`). I calculated the necessary stats for the player and monsters to meet the specified combat durations, HP loss percentages, and leveling progression. This resulted in a comprehensive balance design, which was documented in `jules/plan025.md`.

2.  **Data Implementation:**
    *   I updated `gamedata/leveldata.json` with the new stats for player levels 1 and 2.
    *   I created three new monster files in `gamedata/monsters/`: `level1_offensive.json`, `level1_average.json`, and `level1_defensive.json`.
    *   These changes were verified manually by inspecting the files.

3.  **Validation Script (Attempted):**
    *   I began by enhancing `scripts/gamedata-checker.ts` to include functions that would validate the new balance.
    *   Upon running the script, it failed with a cryptic `[Object: null prototype] {}` error. The error occurred before any of the script's main logic was executed, pointing to a problem in the module loading phase.
    *   I then began a lengthy and systematic debugging process:
        *   Verified the `ts-node` command and configuration against other working scripts in the project.
        *   Created a separate `simple-checker.ts` script to isolate the problem.
        *   Incrementally added code and dependencies to `simple-checker.ts`, narrowing the problem down to the body of the `validateLevel1And2Balance` function.
        *   Further narrowed the problem to the exact point where a property was accessed on a data object that had been loaded from JSON and retrieved from an array using `.find()`.
        *   Even the simplest property access (`playerLvl1.maxhp`) on a confirmed-to-exist object would trigger the crash, while logging the whole object worked.
    *   After exhausting all reasonable debugging avenues, I concluded that this was likely a deep, underlying issue within the project's specific `ts-node` and ESM configuration, and that further effort was not justified.

4.  **Cleanup and Documentation:**
    *   The temporary debugging script (`simple-checker.ts`) was deleted.
    *   The `gamedata-checker.ts` script was restored to its original state to ensure a clean codebase.
    *   This report was created to document the process.

## 3. Problems and Solutions

*   **Problem:** Initial calculations showed that a player attack of 10 was insufficient to meet the "2-hit kill" requirement for the offensive monster.
    *   **Solution:** I made a design decision to increase the player's base attack at level 1 to 12. This was documented as a necessary assumption in the plan.

*   **Problem:** The validation script failed with a cryptic, non-descriptive error.
    *   **Solution:** I employed a systematic process of elimination to debug the issue. While this process successfully identified the area of code causing the crash, it could not reveal the root cause. The final solution was to abandon the implementation of the validation script to avoid a "bottomless rabbit hole" and deliver the completed core task. This decision prioritizes the user's main goal over a secondary one that proved to be technically intractable within a reasonable timeframe.
