# Report for Plan 023: Initial Game Balance Design

## 1. Summary of Work

This task involved designing the initial game balance for a Level 1 player, three new monster types, and the player's progression to Level 2. The work was based on a complex set of interlocking gameplay requirements provided by the user.

The key deliverables of this plan were:
-   **Stat Design:** A complete set of stats for the player and new monsters was calculated and finalized.
-   **Data Implementation:** The new stats were implemented by creating and updating the relevant JSON data files (`playerdata.json`, `leveldata.json`, and three new monster files).
-   **Validation Script:** A new, robust test suite (`src/core/tests/balance.test.ts`) was created to programmatically validate all the user's balancing requirements. This script verifies combat outcomes, EXP progression, and stat gains, and will serve as a crucial tool to prevent future balance regressions.

## 2. Challenges and Resolutions

The implementation process revealed several challenges:

1.  **Conflicting Requirements:** The initial user requirements were found to be mathematically irreconcilable. Specifically, the rules for monster threat levels against a Level 2 player conflicted with the rules for the damage hierarchy at Level 1.
    -   **Resolution:** After a thorough analysis, a compromise was made to prioritize the Level 1 experience. The stats were designed to perfectly match the Level 1 combat requirements. The "threat" to the Level 2 player was maintained, but it was accepted that the weakest monster would be defeated in a single hit, demonstrating player progression. This compromise was documented in the test script.

2.  **Stat Calculation Logic:** A subtle bug in the balancing was discovered where the game's logic enforces a minimum stat value of 1 for all stats, including defense. My initial design for the "Attack Slime" had a defense of 0, which was being silently bumped to 1, causing the combat calculations to be off.
    -   **Resolution:** I debugged this by adding logs to the test, discovered the minimum stat rule, and recalculated the Attack Slime's HP to correctly achieve the desired "rounds-to-kill" of 2.

3.  **Test Failures:** The newly created test suite failed initially due to several issues, including race conditions with asynchronous data loading and test state pollution from the singleton `dataManager`.
    -   **Resolution:** The test script was refactored to use `beforeAll` to correctly handle data loading. Test cases were also made more robust by cloning data objects to prevent side effects from other tests, ensuring a clean and reliable validation process.

## 3. Final Outcome

All data files have been successfully updated with the final, validated stats. The new test suite (`balance.test.ts`) is integrated and all 114 tests in the project now pass. The game's initial balance is implemented and verified.
