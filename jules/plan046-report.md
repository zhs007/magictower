# Task Report: plan046 - Doubao Image Generation Service Integration

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to integrate a new gRPC-based image generation service (`gen_doubao_image`) into the `monstereditor` application. This involved creating new agent tools, updating the agent's workflow and system prompt, and modifying the frontend chat interface to display the generated images.

## 2. Execution Summary

The task was executed according to the plan laid out in `jules/plan046.md`. The process involved a sequence of backend and frontend modifications, followed by verification and documentation updates.

### Backend Implementation

1.  **gRPC Client & Dependencies**:
    - I began by inspecting `protos/doubao.proto` to understand the service contract.
    - I added the necessary gRPC dependencies (`@grpc/grpc-js`, `@grpc/proto-loader`) to the `monstereditor`'s `package.json` and ran `pnpm install`.
    - A new gRPC client was implemented in `apps/monstereditor/src/agent/doubao-client.ts`. This client connects to the service URL specified in the `DOUBAO_GRPC_URL` environment variable.

2.  **New Agent Tools**:
    - Two new tools were added to `apps/monstereditor/src/agent/tools.ts`:
        - `genDoubaoImage(prompt)`: Calls the gRPC service, saves the returned image to a public temporary directory (`monstereditorpublish/`) with a content-hash filename, and returns a public URL.
        - `saveMonsterImage(assetId, imageUrl)`: Copies an image from the temporary directory to the final asset directory (`assets/monster/`), renaming it to match the monster's `assetId`.
    - The tool definitions and exports were updated accordingly.

3.  **Static File Serving**:
    - The `@fastify/static` package was added to serve the temporary image directory.
    - `apps/monstereditor/src/server.ts` was modified to register the plugin and serve `monstereditorpublish/` under the `/public/` URL path.

4.  **Agent Workflow Integration**:
    - The core of the agent's workflow is defined by its system prompt.
    - I significantly updated `apps/monstereditor/prompts/system.md` to provide the AI with a detailed workflow for using the new image generation tools, including when to generate, how to handle user feedback, and the sequence of saving the image and updating the monster's data.

### Frontend Implementation

1.  **Image Modal & Styling**:
    - I first inspected `apps/monstereditor/index.html` to understand its structure.
    - I added new HTML for an image viewer modal and new CSS rules for styling both the image thumbnails in the chat and the modal itself.

2.  **Chat Rendering Logic**:
    - After identifying `apps/monstereditor/src/client/agent.ts` as the file controlling the chat UI, I implemented a new `renderMessageContent` function.
    - This function uses a regular expression to find image URLs in agent messages and replaces them with clickable `<img>` thumbnails.
    - The click event on a thumbnail opens the newly created modal to display the full-size image.
    - The existing message streaming logic was updated to use this new rendering function upon completion.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

- **Initial `ls` command failure**: My first attempt to explore the file system used `ls -R`, which is not a supported syntax for the `ls` tool.
  - **Solution**: I corrected this by using the `ls()` command without arguments to list the root directory, and then listed subdirectories as needed. This was a simple but important learning step about the specific tool implementations available to me.
- **Frontend Component Location**: I initially assumed the chat logic was in `app.ts` because it was the main client entry point.
  - **Solution**: After reading `app.ts`, I discovered the line `initAgentChat()`, which pointed me to the correct file, `agent.ts`. This reinforced the importance of reading the code carefully rather than making assumptions based on filenames alone.

## 4. Verification

- All automated checks passed successfully:
    - `pnpm run typecheck`
    - `pnpm run lint`
    - `pnpm run test`
- This ensures that the new code is syntactically correct, adheres to project standards, and does not introduce any regressions in existing functionality.

## 5. Documentation

- `jules.md`: Updated with a new section (`19.6`) detailing the entire image generation feature, including the new tools, workflow, and required environment variables.
- `agents.md`: Updated to include the new `DOUBAO_GRPC_URL` environment variable, providing critical setup information for future agents or developers.
- `jules/plan046-report.md`: This report was created to summarize the task execution.

Overall, the task was completed successfully, and the new feature is fully integrated and documented.
