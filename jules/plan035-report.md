# Report for Plan 34: Refactoring MapLayout.tileAssets

## 1. Task Summary

The goal of this task was to refactor the `tileAssets` field in the `MapLayout` and `GameState` interfaces. The original structure was a simple mapping from a tile ID to an asset ID string. The new structure is an object containing the `assetId` and a new `isEntity` boolean flag to indicate if the tile is a solid object.

This change required updating the type definitions, all map data files, the map rendering logic, and relevant scripts.

## 2. Execution Process

The task was executed according to the plan:

1.  **Update Type Definitions**:
    *   I defined a new `ITileAsset` interface in `packages/logic-core/src/types.ts`.
    *   I updated the `tileAssets` field in both the `MapLayout` and `GameState` interfaces to use the new `Record<string, ITileAsset>` type.

2.  **Update Map Data Files**:
    *   I iterated through all JSON files in the `mapdata/` directory.
    *   For each file containing a `tileAssets` field, I updated the structure to the new format. `map_wall` was marked as an entity (`isEntity: true`), and `map_floor` was marked as not an entity (`isEntity: false`).
    *   The file `generated_map_v2.json` did not have a `tileAssets` field, so it was skipped.

3.  **Update Codebase**:
    *   I used `grep` to find all usages of `tileAssets`.
    *   `packages/maprender/src/map-render.ts`: The `drawMap` function was significantly refactored to handle the new structure. It now uses the `isEntity` flag to determine whether to render a tile in the `floorContainer` or the `entityContainer`, and it correctly draws a floor tile underneath all entity tiles.
    *   `scripts/check-assets.js`: The script was updated to correctly extract the `assetId` from the new `tileAsset` object.
    *   `scripts/run-gen-map.ts`: The map generation script was updated to output the new `tileAssets` format.

4.  **Testing**:
    *   The test command failed initially because dependencies were not installed.
    *   After running `pnpm install`, I ran `pnpm test` again, and all tests passed successfully.

5.  **Documentation**:
    *   I updated `jules.md` with a detailed explanation of the new `tileAssets` structure, including its fields and an example.
    *   I reviewed `README.md` and determined that no changes were necessary.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was ensuring that all parts of the codebase that used `tileAssets` were updated correctly. The `grep` tool was essential for identifying all the relevant files.

The initial test failure was a simple oversight, and running `pnpm install` resolved it.

## 4. Conclusion

The refactoring of `tileAssets` is complete and successful. The new structure is more expressive and allows for more flexible map rendering. All code changes have been tested, and the documentation has been updated.
